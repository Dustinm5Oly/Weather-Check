## Description

* This application is to be able to allow a user to search a city to display that cities current and following five days of weather while having quick access to previously searched cities.
* My motivation to create this app was to be able to understand how to use API calls to gather information from third party development to populate data on the project.
* I designed this app to allow myself to better understand API calls and display the data needed to the webpage
* The application allows the user to search cities to display weather for those areas through a live webpage. 
* I was able to learn how to generate an API call for singular data as well as multiple variations of data requested.
